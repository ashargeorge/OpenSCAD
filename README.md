## Projects

### Project 01 — Parametric Bolt & Nut Generator

**File:** `project_01_bolt_and_nut.scad`

A fully parametric fastener system modelling an M8 bolt, matching nut, and
washer. Change `bolt_diameter` at the top of the file and every dimension —
thread pitch, head size, nut clearance — updates automatically.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `Syntax` — clean, readable module structure throughout
- `Constants & Operators` — all dimensions derived mathematically from `bolt_diameter`
- `Special Variables` — `$fn` controls circular geometry resolution
- `3D Objects` — `cylinder()`, `sphere()` used as core primitives
- `Transformations` — `translate()`, `rotate()`, `mirror()`
- `Boolean Operations` — `difference()` for thread grooves and holes, `union()` for assembly, `intersection()` for chamfered tip
- `Flow Control` — `if/else` switches between hex and round head types; `for` loop generates thread helix
- `Modifier Characters` — `#` modifier documented for thread debugging

**Key Techniques:**
Thread simulation using a `for` loop of angled cylinder cuts. Bolt head type
selected via `if/else` — set `bolt_head_type = "hex"` or `"round"`.

**How to Use:**

```
bolt_diameter = 8;       // change this — everything updates
bolt_head_type = "hex";  // or "round"
bolt_length = 40;
```

### Project 02 — Geometric Lampshade

**File:** `project_02_geometric_lampshade.scad`

A decorative lampshade built entirely by sweeping 2D profiles into 3D.
The main body is a `rotate_extrude` of a polygon silhouette. The base collar
uses `linear_extrude` with twist. The rim detail is a torus built from
`rotate_extrude` of an offset circle.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `rotate_extrude` — lampshade body swept 360° from 2D polygon profile
- `linear_extrude with twist` — base collar spirals as it rises
- `2D Objects` — `polygon()` defines the shade silhouette; `circle()` for torus cross-section
- `Boolean Operations` — `difference()` punches vent slots through shade wall
- `Flow Control` — `for` loop places 12 evenly-spaced vent cutouts
- `Special Variables` — `$fn`, `$fa` for smooth curves

**Key Techniques:**
The entire lampshade body comes from one 2D polygon. Change the polygon
points and the shape changes completely — this is the power of `rotate_extrude`.
A torus (the rim ring) is built by revolving a `circle()` offset from the axis.

**How to Use:**

```
shade_top_r = 12;       // opening radius
shade_bottom_r = 55;    // base radius — controls flare
vent_count = 12;        // decorative slots around body
collar_twist = 45;      // twist angle of base collar
```

### Project 03 — Mechanical Gear System

**File:** `project_03_mechanical_gear_system.scad`

A complete gear system with a large spur gear, meshing pinion gear, linear
rack, and axles. All gear teeth are mathematically correct involute profiles
generated entirely from list comprehensions — no manual drawing.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `List Comprehensions` — both tooth flanks generated via `[for (i=[...]) let(...) [x,y]]`
- `Flow Control` — `for` loops place every tooth, spoke, and rack tooth
- `Boolean Operations` — `difference()` cuts bore holes, spoke cutouts, chamfers
- `Type Test Functions` — `is_num()` and `is_list()` validate parameters with `echo()` output
- `Lists` — tooth point arrays assembled and passed to `polygon()`
- `linear_extrude` — converts 2D gear profiles to 3D wheels
- `Operators` — full involute trigonometry: `cos()`, `sin()`, `acos()`

**Key Techniques:**
Involute gear geometry from first principles. The `involute_x()` and
`involute_y()` functions compute the mathematically correct tooth curve.
Change `gear_module` and all gears rescale proportionally.

**How to Use:**

```
gear_module = 2.0;      // tooth size — all gears scale from this
spur_teeth = 24;        // large gear tooth count
pinion_teeth = 12;      // small gear (2:1 ratio)
explode = false;        // set true for exploded view
```

### Project 04 — Architectural Building Block Set

**File:** `project_04_architectural_building.scad`

A modular architectural system with walls, windows, arched doors, fluted
columns, and a gabled roof. The entire facade layout is generated from a
nested list comprehension — geometry driven by data.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `Modules & Nesting` — `building` → `facade_wall` → `window_opening` → `arched_door` deep hierarchy
- `Lists` — facade layout stored as `[[bay, floor, has_window, has_door], ...]`
- `List Comprehensions` — nested `[for (bay=...) for (floor=...) let(...) [...]]` generates full layout
- `Boolean Operations` — `difference()` carves openings from walls and flutes from columns
- `linear_extrude` — gabled roof extruded from a 2D triangle polygon
- `Flow Control` — `for` loops over layout list, `if/else` for conditional door/window placement
- `mirror()` — side walls reflected for symmetry

**Key Techniques:**
The layout list comprehension is the architectural highlight — it generates
every window and door position from pure logic. `linear_extrude` of a triangle
polygon produces the entire gabled roof.

**How to Use:**

```
U = 10;                 // base unit — all dimensions scale from this
building_bays = 3;      // number of bays wide
building_floors = 2;    // number of floors
```

### Project 05 — Organic Vase Collection

**File:** `project_05_organic_vase.scad`

Three vase designs, each using a different advanced technique: `minkowski()`
for smooth rounded forms, `hull()` for tapered bridging, and `rotate_extrude`
of a sculpted polygon for a classical profile. Set `vase_style = 0` to render
all three side by side.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `minkowski()` — smooths a tapered hull form into an organic rounded vase
- `hull()` — bridges stacked cylinders at different heights and radii into a smooth taper
- `rotate_extrude` — sweeps a detailed polygon profile 360° for Vase 3
- `List Comprehensions` — generates inner wall profile from outer profile; surface dimple grid
- `concat()` — joins outer and inner profile point lists into one closed polygon
- `Special Variables` — `$fn`, `$fa`, `$fs` all used and explained
- `scale()` — squashes the hull vase for organic non-circular feel

**Key Techniques:**
`minkowski()` with a sphere rounds every edge and corner of the base shape.
`hull()` of cylinders creates transitions impossible with primitives.
The dimple texture grid uses a nested list comprehension to place spherical
cutouts at golden-angle-distributed positions across the surface.

**How to Use:**

```
vase_style = 0;         // 0=all three, 1=minkowski, 2=hull, 3=sculpted
vase_height = 80;       // mm
body_max_r = 34;        // widest point
decoration = true;      // surface decoration patterns
```

### Project 06 — 3D Topographic Map from 2D Contours

**File:** `project_06_topographic_map.scad`

A 3D terrain model built by stacking 2D contour polygon layers at increasing
elevations. This directly demonstrates the JD requirement: _"Build up 3D
shapes from 2D shadows"_ — each contour is the 2D shadow of the terrain at
that height, extruded to reconstruct the 3D surface.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `3D from 2D Shadows` — 8 contour polygons extruded and stacked = full 3D terrain
- `linear_extrude` — every terrain layer is a `linear_extrude` of a `polygon()`
- `Lists` — all contour data stored as nested lists, retrieved by index
- `List Comprehensions` — layer indices, grid positions, color stops generated
- `Type Test Functions` — `is_num()` and `is_list()` validate contour data
- `Flow Control` — `for` loop stacks all 8 elevation layers
- `Boolean Operations` — `difference()` creates base frame recess and border

**Key Techniques:**
The core idea: a 2D contour polygon is the "shadow" of the terrain at one
elevation. `linear_extrude` lifts it to that height. Stack all 8 layers
and the 3D terrain emerges. Elevation-based color mapping using a list of
RGB stops communicates altitude visually.

**How to Use:**

```
contour_count = 8;      // number of elevation layers
layer_height = 4;       // mm per layer
map_scale = 1.0;        // overall scale
color_mode = true;      // elevation colour mapping
```

### Project 07 — Procedural City Generator

**File:** `project_07_procedural_city.scad`

An entire city district generated from a single seed value. Roads, blocks,
buildings, parks, and a central landmark are all computed procedurally using
list comprehensions and deterministic randomness. Change `city_seed` and a
completely different city is produced.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `List Comprehensions` — nested `[for (col=...) for (row=...) [...]]` generates the full block grid
- `Lists` — `gear_train`-style building config list; structured data driving geometry
- `Flow Control` — `if/else` chain classifies building types; nested `for` loops for facade details
- `Type Test Functions` — `is_num()` validates all city parameters
- `Boolean Operations` — `difference()` punches windows, doors, and slots throughout
- `Special Variables` — `rands()` with seed for deterministic procedural variation
- `rotate_extrude` — landmark observation ring, dome cap

**Key Techniques:**
`rands(0, 1, count, seed)` produces a deterministic list of random values —
same seed always gives the same city. The `building_type()` function uses
these values to classify each block as glass tower, stepped tower, cylinder
tower, low block, or park. The entire layout is data-driven.

**How to Use:**

```
city_seed = 42;         // change for a different city
city_cols = 5;          // blocks wide
city_rows = 4;          // blocks deep
block_size = 50;        // mm per block
```

### Project 08 — Twisted Tower Collection

**File:** `project_08_twisted_tower.scad`

Three architecturally inspired towers each using `linear_extrude` with `twist`
differently: uniform twist (Turning Torso), progressive twist (Shanghai Tower),
and faceted polygon twist (Cayan Tower). All four modifier characters are fully
documented with practical use cases.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `linear_extrude with twist` — three distinct applications in one file
- `rotate_extrude` — balcony rails, crown observation ring, antenna dish
- `Modifier Characters` — `#`, `%`, `*`, `!` all documented with real use cases
- `List Comprehensions` — progressive twist curve via `pow()`, window positions, facade panel angles
- `Type Test Functions` — `is_num()`, `is_list()`, `is_string()` in validation module
- `offset()` — expands floor slab profiles for slight overhang
- `Flow Control` — `for` loops for balcony placement, windows, floor slabs

**Key Techniques:**
The progressive twist uses `pow(t, exponent)` to create a non-linear rotation
curve — slow at the base, accelerating toward the top. The faceted tower uses
`circle(r=r, $fn=6)` to produce a hexagonal cross-section that twists as it
rises, catching light on its edges.

**How to Use:**

```
tower_style = 0;        // 0=all three, 1=uniform, 2=progressive, 3=faceted
tower_height = 120;     // mm
uniform_twist = 90;     // total degrees of rotation
facet_sides = 6;        // polygon sides for tower 3 (try 3-8)
```

### Project 09 — 3D Shapes from 2D Shadows

**File:** `project_09_3d_from_2d_shadows.scad`

Four objects reconstructed from their 2D orthographic shadow projections using
`intersection()` of extruded slabs. Demonstrates the formal space-carving
technique used in CT scanning, computer vision, and AI 3D training data
generation.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `intersection()` — three orthogonal extruded slabs intersected = 3D solid
- `linear_extrude` — every shadow projection extruded through space
- `2D Objects` — `polygon()` for chess piece, letter F, bird silhouette, L-bracket
- `Modifier Characters` — `%` modifier renders transparent shadow ghosts alongside the result
- `mirror()` — bird wing symmetry
- `Type Test Functions` — `is_bool()` validates display toggle parameters
- `List Comprehensions` — bolt hole positions, facet angles

**Key Techniques:**
Front shadow extruded along Y axis + side shadow along X axis + top shadow
along Z axis. Their `intersection()` is the only region consistent with all
three views — approximating the original 3D object. The `shadow_ghost()`
module uses `%` to render all three input slabs transparently alongside
the result so the technique is visually clear.

**How to Use:**

```
demo_mode = 0;          // 0=all four, 1=rook, 2=letter F, 3=bird, 4=bracket
show_shadows = true;    // show ghost extrusion slabs
extrude_depth = 80;     // mm — must exceed object extent
```

### Project 10 — Fractal Recursive Tree Collection

**File:** `project_10_fractal_recursive_tree.scad`

Three recursive tree variants demonstrating OpenSCAD's recursion capability:
a binary fractal tree, a wind-swept ternary tree with list-driven branch
angles, and a full organic tree with leaf clusters, root flare, and bark
texture.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- `Recursion` — modules calling themselves with decremented depth parameter
- `Flow Control` — `if/else` termination conditions; `for` loops inside recursive modules
- `Special Variables` — `$fn`, `$fa`, `$fs`; depth as a controlling parameter
- `Modifier Characters` — all four demonstrated; `%` actively used on bounding box ghosts
- `List Comprehensions` — leaf cluster positions via golden angle spiral; root angles
- `rotate_extrude` — root flare buttresses swept from 2D profile
- `Lists` — `wind_angles` list drives three-way branch split angles
- `Type Test Functions` — `is_num()`, `is_list()`, `is_bool()` in validation module

**Key Techniques:**
Each recursive module has two cases: if `depth <= 0` draw a leaf and stop;
otherwise draw a branch and call itself with `depth - 1`. The golden angle
(137.5°) is used for leaf cluster placement — nature's optimal packing angle,
demonstrating mathematical awareness beyond the OpenSCAD basics.

**How to Use:**

```
tree_style = 0;         // 0=all three, 1=binary, 2=windswept, 3=organic
recursion_depth = 6;    // branch levels — keep 5-7 for speed
show_leaves = true;
show_roots = true;
```
